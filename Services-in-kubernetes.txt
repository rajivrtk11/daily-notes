Services in kubernetes:
   Services provide networking between pods.

Types of services
 a) Cluster ip => Sets up an easly-to-remember URL to access a pod. Only exposes pods in
    the cluster. 
 b) Node port => Makes a pod accessible from outside cluster. Usually only used for dev 
    purpose.
 c) Load balancer => Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. This is the right way 
    to expose a pod to the outside world.
 d) External name => Redirect an in-cluster request cname url
