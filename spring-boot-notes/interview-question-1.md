Here’s an elaborated answer to each of these questions, along with alternative explanations or approaches:

---

### **1. Why will you choose Spring Boot over Spring Framework?**

**Answer:**
- **Simplified Configuration**: Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate configurations by using **auto-configuration** and conventions over configuration.
- **Embedded Servers**: Provides embedded servers like **Tomcat** and **Jetty**, allowing you to run applications directly without needing external server installations.
- **Production-Ready Features**: Offers features like **Actuator** for monitoring, **metrics**, and **health checks**.
- **Faster Development**: Spring Boot’s opinionated defaults and **starter dependencies** simplify development by bundling commonly required libraries.
- **Microservices Ready**: Spring Boot is designed for building lightweight, scalable microservices.
- **Testing Tools**: Provides out-of-the-box testing support with simplified configurations for **unit testing** and **integration testing**.

**Alternative Choices**:
- If your project requires **custom configurations** or advanced control over bean wiring, Spring Framework might be more suitable.
- Use **Spring Framework** directly for **legacy system integration** or when lightweight dependency injection is all that is needed.

### **2. What all Spring Boot starters you have used or what all modules you have worked on?**

**Answer:**
Spring Boot starters are pre-defined dependencies for common use cases. Here are some examples:
- **spring-boot-starter-web**: For building web applications.
- **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: For working with databases using JPA/Hibernate.
- **spring-boot-starter-security**: For integrating Spring Security.
- **spring-boot-starter-test**: For testing purposes.
- **spring-boot-starter-actuator**: For monitoring and management.
- **spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf**: For building web applications using the Thymeleaf template engine.
- **spring-boot-starter-mail**: For sending emails.
- **spring-boot-starter-log4j2**: For logging with Log4j2.

**Alternative Use**:
You can manually add dependencies if you want to avoid using starters (e.g., include Spring MVC, Jackson, or Hibernate separately).

### **3. How will you run a Spring Boot application?**

**Answer:**
- **Using IDE**: Run the `main()` method of the class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.
- **Using Command Line**: 
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
  Or, for Gradle:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootRun
  ```
- **Executable JAR**: Package the application and run the JAR file:
  ```bash
  java -jar target/myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```
- **Using Docker**: Create a Dockerfile and build the container:
  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp .
  docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
  ```

**Alternative Ways**:
- Deploy the application to an external server (e.g., Tomcat) if using a **war** package.
- Use **Spring Boot CLI** to run `.groovy` scripts.

### **4. What is the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation in Spring Boot application?**

**Answer:**
- It is a **composite annotation** that combines:
  - `@Configuration`: Marks the class as a configuration class.
  - `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration.
  - `@ComponentScan`: Scans for Spring components in the package.

**Alternative Usage**:
Instead of using `@SpringBootApplication`, you can explicitly declare:
```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
```
This provides the same functionality but requires manual annotation.

---

### **5. Can I directly use the above three annotations in my main class instead of `@SpringBootApplication`, and will my application work as expected?**

**Answer**:
Yes, you can use `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` individually. The application will work as expected, provided you configure them correctly.

**Drawbacks**:
- Less concise: You need to manage multiple annotations.
- You might miss Spring Boot's default configurations if improperly applied.

---

### **6. What is AutoConfiguration in Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**
AutoConfiguration is a feature where Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on the libraries available in the classpath. For example:
- If **spring-web** is on the classpath, Spring Boot configures a **DispatcherServlet**.
- If **H2** or another database library is present, Spring Boot configures a **DataSource**.

**How It Works**:
- Spring Boot uses `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and reads configuration metadata from `spring.factories` files in dependencies.

**Alternative Approach**:
Manually configure required beans using `@Bean` or XML configuration.

---

### **7. How can you disable a specific auto-configuration class in Spring Boot?**

**Answer**:
Use the `exclude` attribute in `@SpringBootApplication`:
```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class)
public class MyApplication { }
```

**Alternative Ways**:
- Use `spring.autoconfigure.exclude` in `application.properties`:
  ```properties
  spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
  ```
- Remove the problematic dependency from your classpath.

---

### **8. How can you customize the default configuration in Spring Boot?**

**Answer**:
- **Override Properties**: Use `application.properties` or `application.yml` to specify custom values.
- **Programmatic Bean Definition**: Create custom beans in a `@Configuration` class.
- **Profiles**: Use Spring Profiles to apply environment-specific configurations.

**Example**:
```properties
server.port=9090
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
```

**Alternative Customization**:
- Provide custom implementations for Spring Boot’s default beans (e.g., customize `DataSource` or `RestTemplate`).

---

### **9. How does the `run()` method in Spring Boot work internally?**

**Answer**:
The `SpringApplication.run()` method:
1. **Launch**: `SpringApplication.run()`.
2. **Environment Setup**: Load properties and profiles.
3. **Bean Registration**: Scan and register components and beans.
4. **Auto-Configuration**: Configure based on dependencies.
5. **Server Startup**: Start the embedded server if it's a web app.
6. **Event Publishing**: Handle lifecycle events.
7. **Ready**: The application is fully initialized and ready to serve.

---

### **10. What is CommandLineRunner in Spring Boot?**

**Answer**:
`CommandLineRunner` is an interface that allows you to run specific code after the Spring Boot application has started.

**Example**:
```java
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) {
        System.out.println("Application has started!");
    }
}
```

**Alternative Ways**:
- Use `ApplicationRunner`, which provides a more structured approach by working with `ApplicationArguments`.
- Add initialization logic directly in the `@PostConstruct` annotated methods.
