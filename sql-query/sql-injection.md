**SQL Injection** is one of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. Let’s break it down in simple terms:

---

## 💥 What is SQL Injection?

**SQL Injection** happens when an attacker inserts or "injects" malicious SQL code into a query, allowing them to:

* 🚨 Read sensitive data (like usernames/passwords)
* 🚨 Modify or delete data
* 🚨 Bypass authentication
* 🚨 Execute admin operations on the database
* 🚨 Even take control of the entire server (in severe cases)

---

## 🧪 How Does It Happen?

Imagine this code in your backend:

```js
const email = req.body.email;
const password = req.body.password;

const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}' AND password = '${password}'`;
db.query(query, (err, result) => {
  // ...
});
```

### 🚨 Hacker Input:

```plaintext
email = ' OR 1=1 --
password = anything
```

### Final Query Becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'anything'
```

* `--` is a SQL comment. Everything after it is ignored.
* `1=1` is always true.

✅ Result: The attacker logs in **without valid credentials**.

---

## ✅ How to Prevent SQL Injection

### 1. **Use Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements**

In Node.js with MySQL:

```js
const [rows] = await db.execute(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND password = ?',
  [email, password]
);
```

This ensures the user input is treated as **data**, not **code**.

---

### 2. **Use an ORM (like Sequelize/Prisma)**

These libraries handle parameterization internally.

```js
User.findOne({ where: { email, password } });
```

---

### 3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

Use libraries like `express-validator`, `Joi`, or `zod`:

```js
body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
body('password').isLength({ min: 6 }).trim().escape()
```

---

### 4. **Least Privilege for Database Users**

* Don't give your app database user unnecessary admin rights.
* Use read-only or restricted accounts where possible.

---

### 5. **Keep Libraries and DB Engines Updated**

Security patches are regularly released for vulnerabilities.

## 🚫 What **Not** to Do

```js
// ❌ Never do this
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`;
```

## 🔐 Summary

| Method                | Secure? | Why                          |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| String concatenation  | ❌ No    | Opens doors to SQL injection |
| Parameterized queries | ✅ Yes   | Separates code from data     |
| ORM libraries         | ✅ Yes   | Handles sanitization safely  |
| Input validation      | ✅ Yes   | Filters bad user input       |
